# React Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my React learning repository! ðŸŒ±

This repository is a collection of various projects, experiments, and exercises that I have/will be developing while learning React. It serves as a log of my progress as I explore different concepts and techniques in React development.

## About

As I continue learning React, I will be building a range of small applications, each focusing on different React fundamentals and advanced concepts. The projects in this repository are diverse and may cover topics such as:

- JSX
- Components
- Props & State
- Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- Event handling
- API integration
- React Router
- Context API and state management

Every project's live link will be added to their own readme file after deployment.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-learning-projects.git
